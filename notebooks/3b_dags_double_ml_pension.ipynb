        "In this real-data example, extended from [the Double ML package examples](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/examples/py_double_ml_pension.html), we will study the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets using observational data. More precisely, we will focus on:\n",

        "### Context\n",
        "\n",
        "The 401(k) data set has been analyzed in several studies, among others [Chernozhukov et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060). 401(k) plans are pension accounts sponsored by employers. The key problem in determining the effect of participation in 401(k) plans on accumulated assets is saver heterogeneity coupled with the fact that the decision to enroll in a 401(k) is non-random. It is generally recognized that some people have a higher preference for saving than others. It also seems likely that those individuals with high unobserved preference for saving would be most likely to choose to participate in tax-advantaged retirement savings plans and would tend to have otherwise high amounts of accumulated assets. The presence of unobserved savings preferences with these properties then implies that conventional estimates that do not account for saver heterogeneity and endogeneity of participation will be biased upward, tending to overstate the savings effects of 401(k) participation.\n",
        "\n",
        "One can argue that eligibility for enrolling in a 401(k) plan in this data can be taken as exogenous after conditioning on a few observables of which the most important for their argument is income. The basic idea is that, at least around the time 401(k)’s initially became available, people were unlikely to be basing their employment decisions on whether an employer offered a 401(k) but would instead focus on income and other aspects of the job."
